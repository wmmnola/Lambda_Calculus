# Lambda Calculus Interpeter

The ultimate goal of this project is to have a complete inteperter of untyped Lambda Calculus, capable of reading an input file of synonoums and functions, and producing output.
The use of such a project is... limited at best. This project will probably only be used by a select few who study Lambda Calculus and it's limits. Specifically, being able to derive all of Mathematics from such a simple logical system.

My final goal is to be able to do regular Calculus, within a Lambda Calculus encoding.

This is perhaps... amibtitous.
